# Robot-Navigation-System
Introduction:
This project explains about an automated guided vehicle (robot vehicle) which will be developed for operating on the roads with real life like environment. The robot will be designed as an outdoor robot which can detect and follow lanes,  traffic  light and stop at an end point.The Robot will also detect obstacle  coming in path and will make decision according to distance from obstacle.The robot will be controlled using  image processing .Traffic signs carry a lot of information about the traffic andenvironmentetc. which provides great assistance in driving. Hence, traffic sign identification is also very important for intelligent transport system or unmanned ground vehicle. The aim of this paper is to present a method for visual servo control using onlyvisual images from a webcam. Visual servo is the use of image data in closed loop control of a robot. Without doubt, today, the use of vision in robotic applications is rapidly increasing. This is due to the fact that vision based sensors such as webcams are falling in price more rapidly than any other sensor. It is also a richer sensor than traditional ranging  devices,particularly since a camera captures much more data simultaneously.
The image is recorded by a webcam which is installed above the robot. The image is then sent via a USB cable to a PC, to be processed by OpenCV.



Objective: 
To develop a robot which will navigate  using image processing and  will  do the following tasks:
•	Traffic light ,lane and stop sign detection
•	Obstacles Avoidance
